# Finding Data  

[UIC's data sources](https://researchguides.uic.edu/c.php?g=252510&p=5246067)
UIC has a list of data sources of various types categorized as "Research Tools" and "Policy Documents" 
If you don't remember what your options are, this is a good place to start. Links to HUD, American Community Survey, USA Gov, CMAP, National Low Income Housing Coalition, Chicago Data Portal, just to name a few. UIC also allow students to access other large data repositories such as ICPSR, Policy Map, and more.

# Framing
Framing is the way that a statistic is reported. Context or comparison groups can influence the interpretation of the statistic. Calculating proportions instead of actual numbers sometimes helps provide the true frame. 

[COVID Cases](https://covid19datahub.io/)
  Guidotti, E., Ardia, D., (2020), "COVID-19 Data Hub",
  Journal of Open Source Software 5(51):2376, doi:
  10.21105/joss.02376.
```{r, verbose = FALSE}
#install.packages("COVID19")
library("COVID19")
x <- covid19("USA", level = 2)
x
```


A city reports that one specific street recycles 2.2 times as much as any other street.  
- Are the streets the same length?  
- Do equal numbers of people live on the streets?  

Measuring recycling at the street level isn't a useful statistic unless streets are otherwise identical.

Alternatives:  
- Recycling amount per living unit  
- recycling amount per person  
- Compare it to the amount of trash  
We want to to adjust the amount recycled to take into account the number of people on the street. 


Water Usage!  
Some districts compare themselves to other districts or cities compare themselves to other cities. Measuring the water used per capita per day.

Alternatives:  
- water use per acre  
- Calculate proportions instead of raw numbers  
 
Findings show that water usage is highest for wealthy neighborhoods with large properties. 


Expenditures

```{r}
# TaxExpenditure <- data.frame(Expenditure.Type = c(factor("Industry & workforce", "Defense", 
#                                                        "Social security & welfare",
#                                                        "Community services & culture", 
#                                                        "Health", 
#                                                        "Infrastructure, transport & energy",

#                              Expenditure.Amount = c(14.843, 21.277, 121.907, 8.044, 59.858, 13.221, 29.870, 96.797))
# 
# ggplot(data = TaxExpenditure,

#         panel.background = element_blank(), 
#         axis.line = element_line(color="gray", size = 1),        
#         axis.text=element_text(size=10), 
#         axis.title=element_text(size=15), 
#         plot.margin=margin(5,15,5,5),        
#         legend.position = "none")

```

### Vocab

Bimodal distriubtion: a set of observations where two values occur more than often than the other values. A graph of the frequency shows two peaks in the distribution. 

**Accuracy**: How close a number is to the true quantity being measured. Different than precision. 
**Precision**: A measure of the level of detail, or resolution, in a number. 98.683 is more precise than 100, but if the true value is 101.00, than a measurement equal to 100 is more accurate. 

**Incidence**: Number of new cases reported in a specific time
**Prevalence**: Number of existing caes (cumulative)


# Univariate Data
Univariate data involves analyzing one variable. It does not deal with causal relationships and it is mostly used to describe the variable. 

## Categorical Data

A categorical variable can only take on a specific set of values representing a set of possible categories. Even if a number is assigned to it for data recording purposes, the numbers do not mean anything (eg. taking the average of: 1. Blue, 2. Orange, 3. Green). This occurs most often when analyzing survey data when information is stored as numbered responses (that work for analysis) and labels (that describe the survey options). 

Categorical variables are also called _nominal_ variables. I always remember this as nominal = numbers have no meaning.

```{r}
# good vs bad examples. Link images.
table(broward$incidentType)
ggplot(broward) + geom_bar(aes(incidentType))
 
#quicktab(anes$V201429)
#table(anes$V201429)

#V202118 # How does the respondent normally vote?
```
Frequencies, proportions, bar charts
```{r}
broward # works!!!!!! 
```
### Binary Variables
Binary: Categorical variables with only two options (Yes/No, 0/1, true/false, etc.). Synonyms include: dichotomous, logical, indicator, boolean
```{r}

```

### Ordinal
This is a type of categorical variable where the responses have a meaningful order. Age groups, income brackets, Likert scales (Strongly Dislike, Dislike, Neutral, Like, Strongly Like) are all ordinal variables. 

These you must approach carefully when doing analysis. 
```{r}
# Income bracket with unequal bracket ranges. Don't just calculate the Average income bracket number.

```


## Numerical Data

<https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/raw/master/other-stats-artwork/nominal_ordinal_binary.png>
```{r}
# good vs bad examples. Link images.
```
### Continuous Variables

Data that can take on any value in an interval
Ex. Age of respondents, 
```{r}
# ANES 2020 Respondent Age
source("anes_functions.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
source("anes_recodes.R", local = knitr::knit_global())


attributes(anes$V201507x)

#anes %>% quicktab(V201507x, "Age")

#quicktab(anes$agecat, "Age")
table(anes$agecat)

```


### Discrete
Data can be only integer values, such as counts.
<https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/other-stats-artwork/continuous_discrete.png>

```{r}
# frequency table, number of people that responded. Can't be fraction. 
```


## Data Distribution 
The density for a continuous distribution is a measure of relative probabily for getting a value close to x. The probability of getting a value in a particular interval is the area under the corresponding part of the curve. (Calc flashbacks...)
```{r}
x <- seq(-4, 4, 0.1)
plot(x, dnorm(x), type = "l") # type = "l" tells R to connect the dots with a line instead of just graphing the points
```



- Frequency Tables 

- Histograms  hist(x)
A histogram is similar to a barplot but is used for numeric data types. Instead of counting the occurrence of each individual value, a histogram divides the data into bins (buckets/ranges) depending on the entire data range and displays the count. It gives an idea abut the distribution of the _numeric_ variable. 
```{r}
ggpot() +
  geom_histogram(aes())
```

- Quantiles


- Q-Q plots 


- Box Plots  
A Box Plot is used to understand the distribution of numerical type data in the data set. It helps to understand how data is grouped, if data is skewed and identify the outliers in the data.

A boxplot represents data in the below categories:
Minimum - Mean â€“ (2 X Standard Deviation)
Q1 - 25th Percentile
Median - 50th Percentile
Q3 - 75th Percentile
Maximum - Mean + (2 X Standard Deviation)
Outlier - The 0.7% of the data which are more than 2 Standard deviations away from mean

```{r}
x <- 0:50
plot(x, dbinom(x, size = 50, prob = .33), type = "h") # h for histogram
```

But how do we describe the data or graphs? 


### Central Tendency 
(Central Tendency RMD)

**Mean**: The average. Has a formula.   
In Excel: =AVERAGE((CELL_1 + CELL_2 + CELL_3)/(Number_Of_Cells))
```{r}
( 4 + 6 + 2 ) / 3
```

Calculate the mean
```{r}
# link generic forumla for equation or type it in
#mean()

# summarize using mean example
```

Discussion on outliers, potential use of trim mean
```{r}
#graph outliers 
# trimmed mean
```

**Median**: Think of the thing between lanes in a road - the median. It is in the center. Equally distanced between both sides. Half of the observations are on one side, and half are on the other. 
Medians are useful for "measuring the middle" when there are outliers.

**Mode**: Observation that occurs the most often.
When is the mean an inappropriate statistic?
Bimodal distributions, groups.
The mean and median might be somewhere between the two but does that tell us anything useful? Bimodal distributions indicate heterogeneity in the sample. If possible, look at the statistics for each group to gain more context.

```{r}
# Murder rates in cities raw vs weighted by population
```

### Measures of Dispersion
How tightly clustered or spread out is your data?

Variance,Deviations, Range, Percentile, Degrees of Freedom

**Variation**: The tendency of variables to change from measurement to measurement  
- Each measurement includes a small amount of error  
- Visualize the distribution of a variables values to find patterns in variation  
  - Chicago  traffic speed example  


**Variability**: The sum of squared deviations from the mean divided by n-1, where n is the number of data values.

**Standard deviation**: Square root of the variance.
```{r}
# include images I made from 402 discussin standard deviation and variability
```

var()
sd()
min()
max()
range()
summary()

## Percentage Change

# Bivariate Data
Bivariate data is used to find out if there is a relationship between two different variables. It is frequently represented with scatter plots where one variable is on the X axis and the other is on the Y axis. If the data seems to fit a line or curve then there may be a relationship, or correlation, between the two variables. Always be careful when examining relationships. Many variables may appear related when in fact their relationship happened by chance or a third variable is influencing both variables.

### Scatterplots
Scatter plots can be used to identify if any relationship exists between numeric variables. 
```{r}
# ggplot() + geom_point()
# ggscatter

 
```



*Test of Association*: Used to test whether two variables are related to one another or not  
- Depends on the nature of the variables you are studying (nominal, ordinal, interval) and number of categories  
- Depends on the nature of the question you're answering (independence, agreement of coders, effect of an intervention, etc.)   

### Patterns and Models

- Could this pattern happen by chance?
- How do you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?
- How strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?
- What other variables might affect the relationship?
- Does the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?

"Variation creates uncertainty but covariation reduces it." - pg 106 

## Correlation 
Correlation is the extent that two continuous (interval or ratio level) variables are related. A relationship exists when knowing the value of one variavble is useful for predicting the value of a second variable. 
```{r}
set.seed(1827)
a.random = rnorm(50)

b.data = data.frame(replicate(100, rnorm(50)))

cor.size = vector()
for (i in 1: 100)
  cor.size[i] = cor.test(a.random, b.data[,i])$estimate

cor.results = vector()
for (i in 1: 100)
   cor.results[i] = cor.test(a.random, b.data[,i])$p.value

```

**Correlation Coefficient**: symmetric, scale-invariant measure of association between two variables  
- Ranges from -1 to +1.  
- Strength of Correlation: 0 means no  correlation, -1 and +1 imply perfect correlation (either one increases as the other decreases [-1] or they move in the same direction[+1])  


"A large and common mistake is to compute correlations of data that are not approximated by bi-variate normal data. Averages, standard deviations and correlations are popular summary statistics for two-dimensional data because, for the bivariate normal distribution, these five parameters fully describe the distribution. However, there are many examples of data that are not well approximated by bivariate normal data. Gene expression data, for example, tends to have a distribution with a very fat right tail."

```{r}
# income summary, ordinal
# head(ANES2020$V202468x )
```

### Pearson Correlation
- assumes there is a normal distribution
- cor() can be used to compute correlation between two or more vectors
- cor.test() tells you if the correlation is significantly different than zero
  - cor.test() has options for different correlation calculations (pearson (default), spearman, kendall)
  - Spearman and Kendall correlation methods are NON-parametric tests, meaning the variables do not meet the assumptions based on a normal distribution. For this course, you do not need to worry about non-parametric tests BUT if you were doing your own analysis, you must remember that the type of test you use depends on your data and look into which tests are appropriate. 
```{r}
#cor(variable1, variable 2, use = "complete.obs")
# cor.test(v1, v2)
# cor.test(v1, v2, method = "spearman") # Spearman's p and Kendall for nonparametric 
```



## Two-Way Tables
- Contingency tables: A tally of counts between two or more categorical variables.

```{r}
# limits to campaign spending and 
#ANES%>% table(V202225, V)
```

- Violin plots: Frequently used for changes in population age
- Boxplots: For categorical and numeric data
- Facet Wrap

###  Unite and Separate 

**unite** is a function that allows you to combine the content of two or more columns. **separate** allows you to separate the content of one column into two or more columns.

_Redo what we did in Excel and add it to the code_

#separate()
```

```{r}
# unite()
```


# Tables

# More Data Visualization 

Course Goal: Summarizing data through effective tables and visualizations (e.g., pie charts, histograms, bar charts, area charts, radars)

Good resource link for me: https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/ggplot2.html#multi-series-ggplot-graphs

Create a "fill in the blank" version of the code for students:
- Read in external data (Excel files, CSVs) 
- Initial data exploration
- Build several common types of graphs (scatterplot, column, line) in ggplot2
- Customize graph aesthetics (color, style, themes, etc.)
- Update axis labels and titles
- Combine compatible graph types (geoms)
- Build multiseries graphs
- Split up data into faceted graphs
- Export figures with ggsave()

## Data visualization Comments

- people are bad at judging angles and areas
  - line and bar chats are usually good options whereas pie charts or charts that use size of an object to represent the magnitude of data are less intuitive BUT this depends on your data and what you are trying to communicate. 

## Bad Graph things - Axis Shenanigans
- Unlabeled axes  
- Truncated vertical axis
- Discontinuity of vertical or horizontal axis
- Double axes with misleading scales

### Crime Data over time example

# Fun Stuff

Mostly just showing what exists, can provide example code for a few topics
- GIFs  
- Maps  
- Twitter Data / Scraping 

# Excel v R commands

In excel, we made pivot tables and pivot charts. Do you remember how many clicks it took to get what you wanted? Image trying to tell someone how to replicate a fancy graph in Excel? In R, we can make the tables and charts with code that anyone can use to recreate your images. It also makes it MUCH easier for you to change your variables and change small aspects of your tables/charts without having to click through a lot of settings and options. 

## Descriptive Statistics

CORREL() and PEARSON() are the same in excel

Desc() from DescTools

Save and SaveAs is write_csv()

MAX(), MIN(), AVERAGE(), COUNT()  STDEV.S() for samples & STDEV.P() for populations
MAX() - MIN() gives you the range


## Visualizing Distributions
```{r}
diamonds # default dataset included in package
```
```{r}
diamonds %>% count(cut) #categorical & ordinal
ggplot(diamonds)+
  geom_bar(aes(cut))
```

Continuous variable,can take any of an infinite set of ordered values. Numbers and date-times are examples of continuous variables. 
```{r}

ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(aes(carat), binwidth = 0.5)
```

**Typical Values** are the common values of a variable.
- Tall bars show common values
- shorter bars show less-common values

1. Which values are the most common?
2. Which values are rare? Is this match your expectations?
3. Any unusual patterns? If yes, what might explain them?

   - Source: Chapter 5: Exploratory Data Analysis pg 88
   
**Unusual Values** are observations that do not seem to fit the pattern, also called outliers. These can occur from data entry errors or may be from interesting points of study.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=y), binwidth = 0.5)
```
It is hard to see the outlier here. The only hint is that the y axis is so wide. This indicates that somewhere around 60, there is an observation of that value, otherwise it would not have been included automatically in the graph. If we want to "zoom in" to see the unusual values, you can add another line of code:
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=y), binwidth = 0.5) + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,50))
```
If you want want to zoom in on the x-axis, there is also an xlim() argument. If we want to visualize or analyze the data without the outliers, we can filter() them out using *dplyr*.
```{r}
obs <- diamonds %>%
  filter(y > 3 & y < 20)  %>%
  arrange(y)
ggplot(obs) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=y), binwidth = 0.5)
```
If we want to examine the outliers closely, we can also use filter to achieve our goals. Outliers are not necessarily a mistake or a bad thing. Many case studies are intensive research on only outliers. (Much of the work I do involves looking at outliers)
```{r}
outliers <- diamonds %>%
  filter(y < 3 | y > 20)  %>%
  arrange(y)
outliers
```
**Missing Values** 


```{r}
# is.na() # 

# ifelse(diamonds %>% mutate( y = ifelse( y < 3 | y > 20, NA, y)))
# if y is less than 3 or greater than 2, change y to a missing value, otherwise leave it alone
```

**Covariation** is when variation describes the behavior _between_ variables (Reminder: variation describes behavior _within_ a singular variable). The easiest way to spot covariation is to visualize the relationship between the two variables. Depending on the types of variables determines the best ways to visualize the relationships.

Categorical & Continuous Variables
A frequency graph does a good job breaking down a continuous variable by a categorical variable. Histograms and vertical or horizontal bar graphs
```{r}

```

**Boxplots** are a type of visual shorthand for distribution. The box stretches from the 25th percentile to the 75th percetile of the distribution (so the middle 50% of all observations, also known as the interquartile range). In the middle of the box is a line that shows the **median** value in the observations. Together, these help show the spread of the distribution, if it is symmetric around the median, and if it is skewed in one direction or the other. 

Outliers that are 1.5 times the IQR are plotted individually.

A line (or a _whisker_) extends from the ends of the box to the farthest nonoutlier point in the distribution. 
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_boxplot(
  mapping = aes(class, y = hwy)
)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_boxplot(
  mapping = aes(x = reorder( class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy)
) + coord_flip()
```
*Two Categorical Variables*
Covariation between categorical variables is os visualized by examing the number of observations for each combination.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x=cut, y = color))
```
```{r}
diamonds %>% count(color, cut) %>%
  ggplot(aes(color, cut)) + 
  geom_tile(aes(fill = n))
```

*Two Continuous Variables*
Scatterplot with geom_point()
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(carat, price),
             alpha = .01) # adds transparency
```


# Codeing Etiquette 

## Comments

You can leave comments in between pieces of code. This will be particularly help when we get to graphs.

```{r eval = F}

# Create a pie chart graph representing the activities done in reality.

reality <- 
  # Call the dataset that I want to use "lockdown_reality"
  ggplot(lockdown_reality, 
  # This section seems to create the basic pie chart graph by setting key parameters
  # fill represents the size of the pie slices
  aes( x = "", y = reality_timespent, fill = reality_activities)) + 
  geom_bar( stat = "identity", color = "red", size = 2) +
  coord_polar( "y", start = 0 ) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
        # Create a legent and put it at the bottom
        legend.position = "bottom", 
        # Eliminate title? 
        legend.title = element_blank(), 
        legend.direction = "horizontal", 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=22, face="bold", color="red"))+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  ggtitle("Reality")
```

_Why so much emphasis on code??_

1. You need to make your code reproducible by others. This means explaining to them (and your future self) what you did at each stage and how the code words.

  - Trust me, you are going to forget

  - Your colleagues will very much appreciate this!

2. This is a way of leanring by noting down stuff that you notice and think about them. It will also help identifying parts that you don't understand about your code and ask questions!


### Nice and ugly codes

Writing "nice" codes is about: 

* Always leave a space before and after a symbol

**Ugly codes**

```{r eval=F}

2*3 

object1<-2

```

**Nice codes**
```{r , eval = F}

2 * 3 

object1 <- 2

```

* This rule applies to commas as well
* BUT we don't leave spaces before and after parantheses

**Ugly codes**

```{r eval = F}

object1<-c(9,3,4,1)

object1 <- c ( 9,3,4,1 )

```

**Nice codes**
```{r , eval = F}

object1 <- c(9,3,4,1)

#Even more correct:
object1 <- c(9, 3, 4, 1)

```

Keep noticing this as we move forward and get yourself used to write nice codes since the very beginning: habits are difficult to change!

Note: When you recode a variable, it's good practice to save it as a new one. 

- It allows you to check your work 

- You might need to go back to the original variable

- If you make a mistake, you don't have to upload your dataset again

- You can always clean your dataframe at the end (e.g., keep only relevant columns)


### Quick exercise

```{r eval = F}
lockdown_exp<-as.data.frame(cbind(exp_activities,exp_timespent))
lockdown_exp

lockdown_reality<-as.data.frame(cbind(reality_activities,reality_timespent))
lockdown_reality

library("ggplot2")
full_plot<-plot_grid(Planned,Happened,
                     align="h",
                     labels="Planned VS Happened During the Lockdown",
                     label_size=27,
                     label_fontface="plain",
                     label_colour="black",
                     label_x=-0.47,label_y=0.95)
```

### Example

**1) Create a vector storing the following values: 3,2,1,4,1 representing the number of hours Mary watched TV this week. Name it appropriately**

**2) Calculate the average number of hours that Mary watched TV**


### ggplot2 Calls

Line of code where each argument is specified:
```{r}
ggplot(data = faithful, mapping = aes(x = eruptions)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.25)
```
Line of code without each argument specified:
```{r}
ggplot(faithful, aes(eruptions)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.25)
```
Including the arguments can be very helpful for your future self or if you are sharing your code with other people. Inclusion of the argument  and clean, readable code can help you find mistakes faster and collaborate easier. 

```{r eval= F}
# Create vector storing the number of TV hours watched
tv_hours <- c(3, 2, 1, 4, 1)

# Calculate the average number of TV hours watched
mean(tv_hours)

# 1. The average number of hours is 2.2

```


R is an open source software whose packages are developed by several individuals around the world. This means that there are several ways to "code" in R and get to the same output.

If needed, you can also set text into your inline codes simply using the format **``` `mean(XXX)` ```**. 

This will report your results into the text and save you time when updating your work! 


Markdown Tips: 
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


You can make little tables with words.

example:


Function | When to use it
---------|--------------------------
**fct_relevel():** | Reorder factor levels by hand
**fct_inorder():** | Reorder factor levels by first appearance
**fct_infreq():**| Reorder factor levels by frequency
**fct_inseq():** | Reorder factor levels by numeric order
**fct_rev():** |Reverse order of factor levels
**fct_reorder():** | Reorder factor levels by sorting along another variable (great fro cat-cont graphs)
**fct_reorder2():** |Reorder factor levels by sorting along 2 other variables
------------------------------------
